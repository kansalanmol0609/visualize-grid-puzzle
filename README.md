# Grid Puzzle Problem
<p>We are given a 3x3 grid having one empty box and 8 numbered boxes. The objective is to reach to final state from initial state. We can swap four adjacent (left, right, above and below) boxes with the empty box. </p>

<strong>Algorithm </strong>
<p> We will start from initial state and generate all possible states. Out of these possible states, we will choose the one state having minimum heuristics (d) value. We will repeat this till we obtain goal state. We have to display path from initial state to final state and intermediate states. </p>

<strong> Project Setup </strong>
<ul>
  <li> In the project directory, run <code> npm install </code></li>
  <li> Now run <code>yarn start </code> </li>
  <li> Runs the app in the development mode</li>
  <li> Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser</li>
</ul>
